Possible domains I could think of:
1. **Preventing Crimes** —> Dropped this idea as that might involve the usage of some IoT devices because real-time surveillance might be required, and I was not very sure about this idea and approach
2. **IRCTC Tracking** —-> But then found out that there is already something similar implemented for airlines
3. **Disaster Early Detection and Relief Tracking**

 **Disaster Early Detection and Relief Tracking**
Agents:
1. Weather Agent: For early detection of disaster. Can be taken from the Swarm AI git but there the weather agent was hardcoded for temperature. So I tried looking up for open source weather APIs. But couldn't found the best one. There was this one Open Weather API but it was free only for 2000 api calls each day.
2. Resource Allocation: To manage resource distribution and transport.

**Well I realised pretty late that this will not work.**
